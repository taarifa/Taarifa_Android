# Taarifa Android app

**THIS CODE BASE IS DEPRECATED AND ONLY HERE FOR ARCHIVAL PURPOSES!**

Taarifa is an open source platform for democratizing information, increasing transparency and lowering the barriers for individuals to share their stories.

The Taarifa Android app synchronizes with any Taarifa deployment allowing viewing and creation of incident reports on the go, while monitoring the workflow and status of reports

The app supports loading of multiple deployments at one time, quick filtering through reports, exploring incident locations on the map, viewing report photos, news article, media as well as sharing reports via email, SMS or Twitter. Once the data has been downloaded, the app can function without an internet connection, allowing accurate collection of data utilizing the device's camera and GPS capabilities.
